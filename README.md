# 2D-Ising-Model-Python

## Description

Simulating 2D Ising model with Monte Carlo Method in Python 3.

## Tutorial

The program is used to simulate 2D Ising model with the primary application of Python 3. I use two methods: Single-spin-flip  and cluster- flip dymanics to deal with this task. 

Before running the program, you should add all the files into the same path. You'd better run the program in main.py unless you want to improve my code.

You can adjust paramaters in main.py simply by changing the default values.

Enjoy your time with Ising and Python! Suggestions and adjustments (as well as STARs) are welcomed.

A detailed introduction of Simulating 2D Ising Model is uploaded on ZHIHU. It is a Chinese version,  [click here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/42629484) to view.

Note: You'll probably need numpy and matplotlib.
